# ThinkPHP 5 Remote Code Execution

[Vulhub](https://vulhub.org)'s [`thinkphp/5-rce`](https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub/tree/8fd63916f7a8711e2e01dda0d27237e4d6175d38/thinkphp/5-rce) environment, by
phith0n and the Vulhub contributors: a ThinkPHP 5.0.20 application, vulnerable to the ThinkPHP 5 controller routing RCE. This repository runs it with
[Isoloom](https://www.isoloom.com): [`isoloom.yml`](isoloom.yml) describes the machine, and
the machine runs Vulhub's published image `vulhub/thinkphp:5.0.20`; the environment folder is vendored in [`app/`](app) and the image's Dockerfile in [`base/`](base).

| Machine | Service |
| --- | --- |
| web | ThinkPHP 5.0.20 (Apache, PHP) on port 80, published on 8080 |

## Run it

```bash
isoloom generate
isoloom run docker
```

Then open http://localhost:8080/ to see the ThinkPHP default page. The same spec runs as Docker on a local VM (`docker-vm`), on a
cloud VM (`cloud-docker`) or on Kubernetes. Lab guide: Vulhub's
[README](https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub/tree/8fd63916f7a8711e2e01dda0d27237e4d6175d38/thinkphp/5-rce/README.md) for this environment, with the walkthrough and references.
