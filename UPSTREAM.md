The vendored folders are that commit, unchanged. The lab runs Vulhub's published image `vulhub/thinkphp:5.0.20`,
pinned by tag (as Vulhub's own compose file does); its Dockerfile is vendored under `base/`
to show how it is built. Building from `base/` instead would download the vulnerable software from its
original sources, some of which are gone.



To update, replace the vendored folders with a newer Vulhub commit, then change this file.
